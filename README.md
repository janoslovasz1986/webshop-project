Simple webshop pet project

My goal is with this project to create a webshop web application from scratch.
It's functionality is expanding weeks by weeks.

At the moment the available functions are:
    for administrators:
      - create Product
      - manage Orders
      - maage Customers


    for anonymous customers:
      - list Products
      - register on the site

    for logged in customers:
      
      - add Product to ShoppingCart
      - make an order from shoppingcart
      - manage personal Orders
            - close order in case of change of mind

Again, the functions are expanding.

Used techologies:
