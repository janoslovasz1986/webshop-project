Simple webshop pet project

My goal is with this project to create a webshop web application from scratch.
It's functionality is expanding weeks by weeks.

At the moment the available functions are:
    for administrators:
      - create Product
      - manage orders


    for customers:
      - put products in shoppingcart

    for logged in customers:
      - make an order from shoppingcart
      - close order in case of don≈±1t want to buy

Again, the functions are expanding.

Used techologies:
  - backend: java spring
  - DB : MySql
  - frontend: thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, javascript
